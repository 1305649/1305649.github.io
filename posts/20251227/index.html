<p>The spiritual and the material form a fundamental opposition within
our understanding of the world. In the recent history of the West, the
focus has been on creating a mainly material ontology, one which
excludes underlying principles as an explanation for worldly phenomena.
Following the enlightenment, this material-causal empiricism has lead to
tremendous technological progress, yet the West has undeniably suffered
from rejecting the importance of the spiritual elements to culture. This
materialization is exactly the death of <strong>metaphysics</strong>, a
field previously concerned with understanding how higher principles
embody in the material. While possibly foreign to modern people,
metaphysics was exactly the object of religion, and the background for
knowledge in traditional thought. Through this blog, I want to explore
religious texts, the decline of Western spirituality, and how similar
trends have impacted culture, domestic politics, geopolitics, and our
general phenomenology.</p>
<p>We seem to be at an inflection point of cultural decay. In fact, we
seem to be at the point of cultural death as predicted by The Unread
Writers. It seems that these trends were also widely recognized in the
20th century (Jung, Guenon, Spengler, Evola), and these very thoughts
now ground the arguments of right-wing reactionaries in the American
political landscape. Peter Thiel’s anti-christ theology is likely based
on the sense of the Death of the West and how apocalyptic theological
text might explain certain phenomena within our culture. Curtis Yarvin
writes about CEO-monarchs as being trad and embodying spiritual
principles towards steering hierarchies of people (it is worth an
attempt to describe how I view institutional decline). By the way,
Yarvin is a fan of Alexander Dugin, a Guenon popularizer, in the exact
same way that Jordan Peterson gains popularity by paraphrasing Jung.
Dugin on the other hand is the definition of a KGB trad larper who is
interested in building Greater Mongolia (more on this later). Since we
have lost the spiritual frame, the culture is more susceptible to
ideological oscillations or general psyops. It is important to
distinguish what is what, and where certain perspectives come from. A
rebirth of a Western metaphysics would likely improve culture, yet there
is no clear way to do this for many reasons. Under this pretext, and if
done incorrectly, we probably risk another antipodal cultural swing.</p>
<p>Principles manifest at fractal levels: from individual psychology to
mass organizations of people. In this sense, we do live in a time of
spiritual warfare. The point of this blog is to make this statement
exact, to identify these spiritual forces, and to understand our current
world through this lens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Since the stars have fallen from heaven and our highest symbols
have paled, a secret life holds sway in the unconscious. That is why we
have a psychology today, and why we speak of the unconscious. All this
would be quite superfluous in an age or culture that possessed
symbols.</em></p>
<p><em>Carl Jung</em>.</p>

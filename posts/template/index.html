    <h1>Modern identity</h1>
    <span class="date">June 24, 2025</span> 

    <p>
    Ancient thought fundamentally differed in its symbolism and meaning, often pointing towards mental categories instead of material ones. In this post, I want to explore a historical perspective of our cultural thought, and to highlight the transition from dualism towards an aspiritual materially oriented phenomenology. This transition in thinking creates gaps in our own sense of identity, and our own understanding of the world as having completely arbitrary structure.
    </p>

    Traditional thought carries the dualist view that Man exists on a higher spiritual level and a lower material level. Across all cultures and traditions, there is a metaphysics that is transcendental: existence is driven by the agreement of the higher, divine, nature and the lower, earthly, existence. The transcendental is principled, infinite and perfected, while the material is confusing, unstructured, and unruly. Though, through manifesting the transcendental, structure can be imposed, while through refining the material, we may glimpse at the transcendental. This process is the focus of traditional knowledge acquisition: understanding the world focuses on extracting the spiritual meaning of a particular event, rather than a total technical account. The goal of traditional life was to manifest the underlying generative patterns that form the transcendental structure of the world: in Christianity, this is reflected by overcoming sin and living within God's divine order / Logos. In all traditions, the metaphysics had a clear spiritual context and were integrated within an intricate cultural framework, providing an orienting force for individuals and civilization. This way of thinking is no longer a part of our culture, and instead, we have adopted a completely restrictive, material frame.

    Can mental events even be considered real? Is an idea/number/moral/aesthetic "real"? Modern science provides only a causal-mechanistic representation of reality that frames knowledge extraction through an entirely material lens. It shifts the focus from spiritual meaning to a technical description of real events, prioritizing pure empiricism instead of seeking concordance with higher principles. This trend, of course, was started in the enlightenment, when essentially these debates defined the rift between Leibniz's idealism and the British empiricists. A defining scientific discovery in this context (which is still mentioned in this context today) is the theory of evolution. Through world exploration, we were able to discover remarkable similarity between creatures, throwing an absurdist-empricist lens on divine creation itself. If the true way that all beings emerged was through evolution, then what evidence is there that the divine could descend down to manifest in the material? This is an example of a type of proto-liberalism: the belief in the fact that material reality itself is king, and that the meaning of "creation" in the Christian context itself no longer had any higher encoded truth: we can simply measure zebra skulls and check (right?). Religion began to be viewed as a type of human construct, and a collective "dream" that people participate in, rather than a voluntary participation in a divine pattern. The strangeness of discovering evolution, and the shift towards empiricism, makes the materialist question whether the explanations offered by tradition in fact mean anything at all. Through this process, we slowly arrived at a worldview where the spiritual component of human existence is completely ignored. This leads to a certain sense of instability: is it possible that the beliefs adopted by the church are completely arbitrary? What, if any, relationship do they have with the world?

    Jung describes religion as a way to organize the "social unconscious": the primeval categories that structure thinking. He believes that our unconscious operates in shared representations of psychological phenomena, which require a grounding system to properly integrate into cognition. One way to structure such forms is through a religion, in which the social unconscious and its relationship to the individual is mediated through a religious framework. The individual understands their role in the divine, and exists in cohesion with others that manifest the same truth. Jung suggests that, while religion is the traditional development, its absence in our culture provided an empty canvas for the rise of ideological belief. The tyrants of the 20th century created cultural myths, suggested ideals that were derived from false principles, and provided people an organizing framework that was totally non-existent. Communism, nazism, libertarianism, all attempt to project the material realities as descending from a single fact that drives their cause: Marx from class warfare, Hitler from the Jews, and libertarians from an oppressive government. In fact, Jung argues that humanity requires a framework to structure the material, or else the chaos and unknown of the world becomes overwhelming. In the midst of this, the individual suffers a total lack of personal identity, or a false identity within some constructed system. The culmination of this spiritual sterility were the genocides of the 20th century: the search for modern identity lead to the creation of out-groups and mass genocide. These events were, however, consistent within the ideological system -- yet cannot be consistent with any possible form of truth or good.

    In response to the second world war, even more questions remain. The mechanism by which meaning is extracted and attributed to the world around is even more obfuscated. More importantly, the question of identity outside a mediating framework has come to center. Deleuze proposes a truly schizophrenic resolution that fundamentally underlies post-modern, especially left-wing and liberal thinking. He suggests that we must reject any framework that mediates material reality. If there existed such a framework, and since it is arbitrary (and it is of course), then it must be rejected since it may create false identities that lead to mass suffering. As a consequence of the rejection of any higher framework, there can be no hierarchy of ideas, since if there were, this would imply a moving-upwards to an ideal. In particular, DeLeuze suggests that all knowledge and therefore identities are totally relative. That is, objects differ so far as they are different from each other: this suggests that we cannot even experience the higher idealized forms of any object, since it would imply the existence of an ideal (related to modern art, more on this later). In actual fact, the idea of DeLeuze is to ignore base structures of discernment altogether, which is embodied in many leftist ideals. For example, the existence of male and female is confused as saying "male and female exist so long as they are different" -- then every parameter that they differ by implies the existence of a previously "undiscovered" category, by the DeLeuzian logic. (The existence of mental "feeling" for different genders implies that there exist immaterial categories that are more "real" than material ones -- checkmate libtards?) Such ideas have passed into the 21st century, where they are implicitly integrated into our political culture

    Where are we now? In the 21st century, we have culturally abandoned the transcendental as a dimension of our life. Most people have no higher force driving them towards something: there is no real spiritual or ideological framework that provides it. We exist in a totally confused time, and as Jung predicted, the currents of the collective unconscious may cyclically erupt and collapse into ideological belief. Through the Enlightenment we have actually entered Kali Yuga. Spengler's 200 years of Caesarism are starting.

    At a personal level, the wonderful people I have met are all driven by the final and unbreakable glimpse of the transcendent: the beautiful. It is difficult to find a higher principle within the material, yet within existing between the material slop, there is still the pursuit of that which is truly aesthetic. 
    </p>
    <p>
    It is beautiful to be better and take pride in good actions. And it is a form of love for yourself and for the people around you. Identity emerges from this, and not from a top-down imposition that comes from Babylon or Earth. Instead, the ultimate identity, YAHWEH, means "I Am That I Am": God is the complete identification of the perfected and principled in the earthly.

    I hope that this account has been somewhat coherent. I hope to learn much more about all the things I touched on, and would love to discuss it with you. Some more things I'd like to talk about:
